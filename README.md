# Breaking-Change-Validator 

</div>

Managing multiple repositories that depend on each other can be challenging, especially when changes in one repository break the functionality of another. This is even more difficult when these repositories are maintained by different teams or individuals.

Breaking-Change-Validator is a GitHub Action designed to address this issue. It validates whether changes in a branch break a dependent library that relies on its interfaces. By integrating this action into your workflow, you can catch breaking changes early in the development process, reducing the risk of discovering issues late in the release cycle or, worse, after deployment.

This action is particularly useful for teams working on interconnected projects, ensuring seamless collaboration and maintaining the integrity of dependent libraries.

To use this action in your GitHub workflow, add the following step to your workflow file:
```yml
- uses: attiasas/breaking-change-validator@v1
  with:
    repository: <REPOSITORY_CLONE_URL>
```

Replace `<REPOSITORY_CLONE_URL>` with the clone URL of the repository you want to validate against.
