# Breaking-Change-Validator 

</div>

Managing multiple repositories that depend on each other can be challenging, especially when changes in one repository break the functionality of another. This is even more difficult when these repositories are maintained by different teams or individuals.

Breaking-Change-Validator is a GitHub Action designed to address this issue. It validates whether changes in a branch break a dependent library that relies on its interfaces. By integrating this action into your workflow, you can catch breaking changes early in the development process, reducing the risk of discovering issues late in the release cycle or, worse, after deployment.

This action is particularly useful for teams working on interconnected projects, ensuring seamless collaboration and maintaining the integrity of dependent libraries.

## üèóÔ∏è Usage

To use this action in your GitHub workflow, add the following step to your workflow file:
```yml
- uses: attiasas/breaking-change-validator@v1
  with:
    repository: <REPOSITORY_CLONE_URL>
```

> Replace `<REPOSITORY_CLONE_URL>` with the clone URL of the repository you want to validate against.

### PR Comment generation

If the action runs on a related PR, you can optionally configure the action to generate a comment on it if issues are detected and not resolved.

#### Preconditions

`GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable - GitHub token with `pull-requests: write` permission.

You can utilize [$\{{secrets.GITHUB\_TOKEN\}}](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication), which is an automatically generated token by GitHub.

## üß™ Issue Remediation

### Remediation Label
In order to resolve the issues raised by the action you can specify the `remediation_label` input.
If provided, the action will check if the related pull request is labeled with this value and mark the issues as resolved.

#### Preconditions

Make sure to add the related pull request types to capture when labels are changed.
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [labeled, unlabeled, opened, edited]  # Run when labels change or PR events occur
